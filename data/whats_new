        <p>Bugfixes:</p>
        <ul>
	  <li>Fixed a bug where "Export Figure" and "Preferences" could not be loaded</li>
	  <li>Fixed an upstream bug in Matplotlib where part of the Graph would be cut off at scaled resolutions.</li>
	  <li>Fixed a bug where the legend styles could not be deleted</li>
	  <li>Fixed a bug where the legend styles could not be reset to defaults</li>
	  <li>Fixed a bug where the legend would remain when all data is removed</li>

	  <li>Removed some shortcuts that were overlapping with typing a capital character, making it difficult to write a capital for the respective characters in titles and labels.</li>
