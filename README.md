  Graphs is a simple, yet powerful tool that allows you to plot and manipulate your data with ease. You can import data from two-column files or generate it via an equation. All data can be manipulated using a variety of operations.
  Graphs lets you customize the style of plotted data. You can add and edit stylesheets in detail.
  Graphs is an excellent fit both plotting and data manipulation. The plots created with Graphs can be saved in a variety of formats suitable for sharing and presenting to a wide audience, such as in a scientific publication or presentations. It is also possible to save the plots as vector images, which can be easily edited in programs like Inkscape for further customization and refinement. Graphs is written with the GNOME environment in mind, but should be suitable for any other desktop environment as well.

The operations include:
  - Shifting data
  - Normalizing Data
  - Smoothening data
  - Centering Data
  - Cutting Data
  - Combining Data
  - Translating data
  - Derivative and indefinite integral
  - Fourier Transformations
  - Custom transformations using anything that is compatible with the numpy module
